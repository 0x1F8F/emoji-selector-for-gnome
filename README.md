# Emoji Selector (for Gnome)
This basic Gnome shell extension provides a simple popup menu with some emojis in it ; Clicking on an emoji copies it to your clipboard.

## New features of the version 2
The version 2 includes a new way to display emojis, on a grid (which is far better), and translations.

## Installation
The better option is to install it from extensions.gnome.org

> How to manually install the extension ?

Download files and put them in an "emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr" folder to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again").

> It's ugly !

It will be less ugly if you have the « Twitter Color Emoji » font, or the « EmojiOne Color » font installed on your system. These fonts are on github, use the search bar.

## Your eventual observations :
> Can you add a "last used" category ?

Maybe in a future, yes.

> Can you translate the extension in XXXXX ?

The extension is available in english, french and german.

I only know french and english, so if you need a specific language, please contribute : you just have to be inspired by the existing .po files !

> There is no racialized smileys / LGBT peoples / gender-specific activities / "numbers in square" symbols :'(

I'm sorry about that, but most fonts have a bad technical support for these caracters, which didn't display well (at least on my computer), so i prefered doing without these emojis.
However the source code is actually VERY simple, so you can easily edit it (even if you don't know javascript), and add yourself whatever you need.
