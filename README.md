# Emoji Selector (for Gnome Shell)

- lots of parametrable things

(Color emojis depends on your system, not on the extension.)

## Installation

### Default way to do
The better option is to install it from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1162/emoji-selector/

### For Arch Linux users
Arch Linux users can install [gnome-shell-extension-emoji-selector-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-extension-emoji-selector-git/) from **AUR**.

### Manual installation
Download files and put them in an "emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr" folder to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again", or `alt` + `f2` + `r` + enter).

## About fonts
It will be less ugly if you have the « [Twitter Color Emoji](https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font/releases) » font, or the « [EmojiOne Color](https://github.com/emojione/emojione) » font installed on your system. These fonts are on github.

**Arch Linux** users can install [emojione-fonts from **AUR**](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/emojione-fonts/).

## Your eventual observations :
> Settings don't apply

Yes sorry it's not automatic for all settings. Disable the extension, re-enable it, and it will be applied.

> Can you translate the extension in (some language) ?

The extension is currently available in english, french, brazilian portuguese, italian, esperanto and german. I only know french and english, so if you need a specific language, please contribute : you just have to be inspired by the existing .po files !
