> How to manually install the extension ?

Copy the "emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr" folder to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and then restart the environnment like a dick with Alt+F2 (type r in the prompt).

> It's ugly !

It will be less ugly if you have « Twitter Color Emoji » or « EmojiOne Color » font installed on your system.

> Can you add a "last used" category ?

Maybe later, yes.

> Can you translate the extension ?

You can be sure i will, since i'm not a competent english-speaker.

> There is no racialized smileys / LGBT peoples / gender-specific activities in your extension, you fascist !

I'm sorry about that, but most fonts have a bad technical support for these "compound" emojis, so i prefer doing like this.
However the source code is actually very simple, so you can easily edit it (even if you don't know javascript), and add it yourself.
