# Installation
> How to manually install the extension ?

Copy the "emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr" folder to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and then restart the gnome shell environnment like a dick with Alt+F2 (you just have to type r in the prompt).


> It's ugly !

It will be less ugly if you have the « Twitter Color Emoji » font, or the « EmojiOne Color » font installed on your system.

# Your eventual observations
> Can you add a "last used" category ?

Maybe later, yes.


> Can you translate the extension ?

You can be sure i will, since i'm not myself a competent english-speaker.


> There is no racialized smileys / LGBT peoples / gender-specific activities in your extension, you fascist !

I'm sorry about that, but most fonts have a bad technical support for these "compound" caracters, so i prefered doing without these emojis.
However the source code is actually very simple, so you can easily edit it (even if you don't know javascript), and add yourself whatever you need.
