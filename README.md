## Installation
The better option is to install it from https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1162/emoji-selector/

> How to manually install the extension ?

Download files and put them in an "emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr" folder to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

You may need to restart the gnome shell environnment ("logout and login again", or alt+f2 + r + enter).

> The screenshot looks great but it's ugly on my computer !

It will be less ugly if you have the « [Twitter Color Emoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/releases/) » font, or the « EmojiOne Color » font installed on your system. These fonts are on github, but be careful with EmojiOne Color, the recommended way to install it may cause problems to your system.

## About Dash to Panel
The very popular extension "Dash to Panel" seems to cause some problems with my extension. 
You need to set a number of emojis per line around 25 to solve the issue.

## Your eventual observations :

> A search entry ?

Maybe in the future.

> Can you translate the extension in [some language] ?

The extension is currently available in english, french, portuguese, italian, esperanto and german. I only know french and english, so if you need a specific language, please contribute : you just have to be inspired by the existing .po files !

> There is no racialized smileys / LGBT peoples / gender-specific activities / "numbers in square" symbols :'(

I'm sorry about that, but most fonts have a bad technical support for these caracters, which didn't display well (at least on my computer), so i prefered doing without these emojis.
