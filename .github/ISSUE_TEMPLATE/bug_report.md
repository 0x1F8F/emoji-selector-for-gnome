# System

- OS: 
- Your version of the extension (visible in the "about" tab of the preferences window):
- Your version of GNOME Shell: 
- Most recent GNOME Shell version that is supposed to work ([visible here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1162/emoji-selector/) in the dropdown):
- Is the extension supposed to work with your version of GNOME Shell [y/n]:

<!-- If the answer to the last question is "no", consider the fact that i use my own extension and i'm not blind. I just can't fix issues related to GNOME Shell updates before getting these updates, so you should wait until i get the update instead of opening issues. -->
